Hey, outsider, are you here for the snakes? They're all in the snake cave of the underground river at the bottom of the well.

*name=Batking incarnate shrine*

||Batking incarnate shrine:

location: doorway;northern town;87;55;Mario Basin
To fight the Bat King Incarnate, you need to form a team and enter together. It's best to have a melee class and healing class in your team. The melee class can attract the monster's attention and deal defense break to it in the front, while the healing class can heal the HP of team members in the back. This is a good way to withstand the monster's attack.
The melee class can use defense break skills in succession within the effective duration of each defense break skill to achieve maximum defense break effect. Then, they need to keep dealing defense break to maintain the effect.
And the healing class need to remember not to heal too much HP, as doing so will make him/her generate a significant amount of threat from the bat king, causing it to attack the healing class instead. In combat, you can open up the target information window frequently to check the Bat King's threat.
If your team has long-range classes, they can greatly increase the damage dealt to the monster, but they also need to pay attention to avoid generating too much threat and attract the monster's attention.||

After entering the stairwell, the warrior needs to head north to enter the aisle on the east or west side of the base (depending on which side the stairwell is on), then they can enter the control room to operate the electronic console and connect the fuse. When the fuses on both sides are connected, the explosives will be detonated and blast all the demons in the main barrack to pieces.

After passing through the South battery, go to the warehouse in the middle to get two keys, and then open the two locked doors of the Middle battery. After unlocking, lead out the guards inside the middle battery and kill them.
Then be sure to divide into two roads, enter the middle battery from the north and south entrances at the same time, and go west to smash the two antiaircraft guns on the middle battery.If you don't smash the two cannons of the middle battery, you will be attacked by the middle battery after leaving the fort. Then attack the North battery in the same way as the South battery.
After entering the base, kill a group of guards first, then two players prepare to destroy shells in the south guard room, and one player accacks a smoothbore gun in the north guard room. The smoothbore gun can hold five shells, and you need to lead it to fire up all of its shells before approaching. At this time, the conveyor belt in the south will supply shells to the smoothbore gun. Players in the south need to smash the shells on the conveyor belt in time to prevent the smoothbore gun from being replenished and causing damage to players in the north.||

Long, long ago, the ancient Sealed Land was not as it is now, nor was it called the Sealed Land. At that time, there was a human tribe settled here called the Kaschi
The Demon Realm's incursion forced Amryd, the last leader of the Kaschi to undertake a perilous migration with his tribe towards the central continent, where the Mist God's barrier offered protection. The journey itself was a brutal trial, and the tribe suffered countless losses.
Amryed needed immense power to protect his people. His will was sensed by an unknown, immeasurable mist god, who granted him great strength.
As Amred protected his people and was about to reach their destination, his body suddenly changed and turned into a black mist. Amred also lost his kindness and only had the desire for killing, killing all the lives in the Kaschi tribe.
With the aid of Matthew, God of Mists, the Great Heroes sundered the lands of the Kaschi Tribe from the continent, sealing them within a gate. This gate was named the Gate of the portal of the demon world.

||Calabash Brothers' Wish (Slightly Difficult)

location: pedestal;14;42;portal of the demon world
Legend has it, deep within the Calabash Mountains, two malevolent spirits lay imprisoned: the Scorpion Demon and the Serpent Demon. One day, a pangolin, by unfortunate chance, burrowed through the cavern walls, unleashing these two fiends upon the world. From that moment, the common folk suffered greatly. The pangolin, filled with remorse, was rescued by a wise old man. The pangolin revealed to him that only by cultivating the Seven-Colored Calabash could these demons be vanquished. The old man, taking a single calabash seed, planted it and watched as it bore seven magnificent gourds: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. However, the demons, peering through their mystical Ruyi Mirror, espied the growing calabashes. Unable to destroy them, they instead seized the old man who had nurtured them. One by one, the seven calabashes ripened and fell to the ground, transforming into seven barefoot young boys, each clothed in the color of their respective gourd. To defeat the demons and rescue their elder, these Calabash Brothers, one after another, bravely set forth to confront the fiends.
Big Brother has great strength, but he’s courageous without much cunning. After being tricked by the Demon into a swamp, his energy center was sealed, he was trapped by spider webs, and later hypnotized by the magical Ruyi staff. Second Brother has the abilities of farsight and keen hearing, but the Demon blinded him with a light sword and damaged his left ear. He was later rescued along with the old man by the pangolin and Third Brother. Third Brother has a head of bronze and iron arms; he saved Second Brother and the old man and smashed the magic mirror, but in the end, he was trapped by the demon with a Yin-Yang sword and pinned by a huge stone. Fire Brother can control flames, and Water Brother excels at manipulating water. While picking herbs for Second Brother, they accidentally saved two Demon and were later tricked by the Demon —Fire Brother was made drunk with Chilling Spring Wine, and Water Brother with Soul-Drain Wine. Later, with help from a bird, Second Brother regained his sight and hearing, but together with his yet-to-be-born Sixth and Seventh Brothers, he was captured by the Demon  and tied to a giant spiked boulder. Sixth Brother possesses the power of invisibility. He secretly snuck into the Demon lair, reclaimed the Ruyi staff, and rescued his five elder brothers. Meanwhile, the purple gourd was blackened by the snake demon, and Seventh Brother, under the Demon control, absorbed his brothers into the bio-absorbing gourd in his hand—only to also be captured by the Demon in the end.
Warriors, traverse time and space to change the ending of the Calabash Brothers! The kind old Grandpa, the brave Pangolin, and the poor little Butterfly are waiting for you to rescue them.
