        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Storm Riders gang! As a valued member of our community, it is essential to understand and adhere to the rules and guidelines that ensure our gang operates smoothly and effectively. Please note that these rules are subject to change at the discretion of the gang leader. Any changes will be promptly communicated to all members.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to maintain a fair and supportive environment. As such, members who fail to comply with the rules will receive a warning, which will remain in effect for three months. Warnings can be issued based on the written rules or for other serious offenses as determined by the gang leader. It is crucial to stay informed and actively participate in the following gang activities to avoid any potential penalties.</p>

        <h2>Rule 1: Gang Duties</h2>
        <p>Every player, including all of the elders, must fulfill gang duties. They currently include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Donating</li>
            <li>Building the gang constructions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If players do not comply with this rule, either by not fulfilling any of the above duties, only part of them, or by fulfilling them only occasionally, they will be warned. If their activity does not change in any way even after a warning, they will be expelled from the gang, without the need for further warning or information about this fact.</p>
        <p>If anything will prevent the player from fulfilling gang duties at a certain time, this must be reported to the gang leader in advance. The gang leader does not have to and will not investigate why the players aren't fulfilling their duties.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Donation and construction logs will be checked regularly every week. Every gang member must build and donate at least 6 times a week for successfully completing their gang duties.</p>

        <h2>Rule 2: Player Activity</h2>
        <p>Every player, including all of the elders, must play with their character or characters. However, playing is a very broad concept, and therefore I have to focus on the only aspect through which it can be monitored, character levels.</p>
        <p>To enhance our overall gang's activity, it is required to level up at least by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two levels per month for characters under level 50</li>
            <li>One level per month for characters at or above level 50</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> While achieving these goals, it is highly encouraged to both seek help and offer assistance to fellow gang members through the gang channel or WhatsApp group. Collaboration and mutual support are key to our success and growth as a community.</p>

        <h2>Rule 3: Completing Missions</h2>
        <p>Missions are the third way to increase the gang's index and significantly contribute to our overall progress and success. While they are not currently mandatory, their importance cannot be overstated.</p>
        <p>Completing missions provides valuable rewards and boosts our gang's index and balance. Therefore, all members are highly encouraged to actively engage in missions whenever possible. By working together on these tasks, we can achieve greater accomplishments and solidify our position in the gang ranking.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If we fail to reach the necessary gang index, participation in missions will become mandatory.</p>
