Hey, outsider, are you here for the snakes? They're all in the snake cave of the underground river at the bottom of the well.

*name=Batking incarnate shrine*

||Batking incarnate shrine:

location: doorway;northern town;87;55;Mario Basin
To fight the Bat King Incarnate, you need to form a team and enter together. It's best to have a melee class and healing class in your team. The melee class can attract the monster's attention and deal defense break to it in the front, while the healing class can heal the HP of team members in the back. This is a good way to withstand the monster's attack.
The melee class can use defense break skills in succession within the effective duration of each defense break skill to achieve maximum defense break effect. Then, they need to keep dealing defense break to maintain the effect.
And the healing class need to remember not to heal too much HP, as doing so will make him/her generate a significant amount of threat from the bat king, causing it to attack the healing class instead. In combat, you can open up the target information window frequently to check the Bat King's threat.
If your team has long-range classes, they can greatly increase the damage dealt to the monster, but they also need to pay attention to avoid generating too much threat and attract the monster's attention.||

Then, keep going north, and they will find the explosive base.
There are patrolling demons in both the warning corridor and insulated corridor. The warrior must be careful not to be spotted by them. If the patrolling demons found you, they will rush back to the main barrack to sound the alarm, leading an army of demons to hunt down and kill the warrior.

The warrior needs to head to two places, which are the east and west control rooms that are accessible through Stairwell No. 1 and Stairwell No. 20 on the farthest sides of the corridors respectively. After entering the stairwell, the warrior needs to head north to enter the aisle on the east or west side of the base (depending on which side the stairwell is on), then they can enter the control room to operate the electronic console and connect the fuse. When the fuses on both sides are connected, the explosives will be detonated and blast all the demons in the main barrack to pieces. The warrior can then go south from the Control Room to the main barracks, destroy the core components of the base, and complete the quest.

There is an antiaircraft gun in each of the four corners of the South battery. When entering the South battery, warriors need to run to the east and west sides at the same time to smash the antiaircraft gun in the corner, and then go north to smash the other two antiaircraft guns.
After passing through the South battery, go to the warehouse in the middle to get two keys, and then open the two locked doors of the Middle battery. After unlocking, lead out the guards inside the middle battery and kill them.
Then be sure to divide into two roads, enter the middle battery from the north and south entrances at the same time, and go west to smash the two antiaircraft guns on the middle battery.If you don't smash the two cannons of the middle battery, you will be attacked by the middle battery after leaving the fort. Then attack the North battery in the same way as the South battery.
After entering the base, kill a group of guards first, then two players prepare to destroy shells in the south guard room, and one player accacks a smoothbore gun in the north guard room. The smoothbore gun can hold five shells, and you need to lead it to fire up all of its shells before approaching. At this time, the conveyor belt in the south will supply shells to the smoothbore gun. Players in the south need to smash the shells on the conveyor belt in time to prevent the smoothbore gun from being replenished and causing damage to players in the north.||
